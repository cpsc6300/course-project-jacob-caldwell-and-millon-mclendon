# Project Description
## Probelm Statement and Motivation
We aim to analyze MLB data to better come up with a plan to form a winning forumla and improve a teams overall odds of winning. This motivation comes from our love for sports and simply wanting to improve our "teams" chances of winning.

## Introduction and Description of Data
This problem is important because there has been a recent shift within professional baseball to use numerical analysis of statistics to adapt there team and to optimize their playstyle in order to perform better. Teams are using these numbers to try to win more games and as a result make their teams more successful. 

This problem is challenging because there are multiple statistics that are used in collaboration with others that help teams to determine a player's worth. We are attempting to use some of these statistics to help better gauge a player's worth to the team, which is a challenging and complex problem that many teams are still trying to solve

# Plan
1.) Port in the data
2.) Clean and organize the data
3.) Begin making inferences on the data
4.) Using algorithms to check those inferences
5.) Come up with ways to better improve overall efficenty of a team
6.) Use visuals to better explain our findings
