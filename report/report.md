# Probelm Statement and Motivation
We aim to analyze MLB data to better come up with a plan to form a winning forumla and improve a teams overall odds of winning. This motivation comes from our love for sports and simply wanting to improve our "teams" chances of winning.

# Introduction and Description of Data
This problem is important because there has been a recent shift within professional baseball to use numerical analysis of statistics to adapt there team and to optimize their playstyle in order to perform better. Teams are using these numbers to try to win more games and as a result make their teams more successful.

This problem is challenging because there are multiple statistics that are used in collaboration with others that help teams to determine a player's worth. We are attempting to use some of these statistics to help better gauge a player's worth to the team, which is a challenging and complex problem that many teams are still trying to solve

# Literature Review/Related Work 
This could include noting any key papers, texts, or websites that you have used to develop your modeling approach, as well as what others have done on this problem in the past. You must properly credit sources.

# Modeling Approach

+ Describe the baseline model.
+ Describe your implementations beyond the baseline model and the design choices that you have made.

# Project Trajectory, Results, and Interpretation 

Briefly summarize any changes in your project goals or implementation plans you have made.
These changes are a natural part of any project, even those that seem the most straightforward at the beginning.
The story you tell about how you arrived at your results can powerfully illustrate your process. 

Next, show your results. How well does your model and/or implementation perform? Did you meet your goals?

Finally, give some interpretation. What do your results mean? What impact will your work have?

# Conclusions and Future Work
Summarize your results, the strengths and short-comings of your results, and speculate on how you might address these short-comings if given more time.

# References:
This could include the revised key papers, texts, or websites that you may use to develop your project.

# Support Materials
Provide a list of materials that support your project, for example, the notebooks and data sources.
